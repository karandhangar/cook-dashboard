"Iâ€™m working on a web application for cooks who provide subscription-based meal services. The app allows cooks to manage their profile, weekly menus, and dishes effectively. Key features include:

Profile Management :
A profile page where cooks can view their details (name, email, phone, address, bio, cuisine specialization, experience).
An 'Edit Profile' page with fields to update personal information and upload or change a profile picture.
Menu Management :
A 'Menus Page' where cooks can create and manage their weekly menus.
A 'Dish Pool' section to add, edit, and delete dishes (including name, description, price, and image).
A weekly schedule grid (Monday to Sunday for 4 weeks) to assign dishes from the Dish Pool to specific days.
Buttons at the bottom of the Menus Page: 'Save Menu' (to save changes and redirect to the dashboard) and 'Clear All' (to reset the page).
Dashboard :
Displays an overview of recent activities, statistics (e.g., total dishes, active subscriptions), and quick action buttons.
Design and Layout :
A clean, modern UI with a sidebar for navigation (Dashboard, Profile, Menus, Orders, Customers, Settings).
Custom CSS styling without Bootstrap, using Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts.
Consistent button styles (hover effects, colors, padding) across the app.
Additional Features :
A footer with company logo, links, social media icons, and copyright information.
Interactive components like modals for adding/editing dishes and assigning them to days in the schedule.
Button Functionality :
All buttons in the application should be fully functional:
Navigation buttons (e.g., in the sidebar or action buttons) should take users to related pages (e.g., Dashboard, Profile, Menus).
Action buttons (e.g., Save, Clear All, Edit Profile) should either trigger forms, display popup windows, or perform actions like saving data or resetting the page.
The goal is to build a user-friendly interface that helps cooks efficiently organize their subscription-based meal plans while maintaining a professional look and feel. Please help me refine or expand any part of this concept if needed."
